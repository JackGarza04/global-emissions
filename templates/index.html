			What are Greenhouse Gases?
		</h1>
		<p class="text">
			Greenhouse gases generated by human activity are the leading cause of modern climate change. The three major ones that are provided and measured in this data sample are CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide), N<sub>2</sub>O (Nitrous Oxide), and CH<sub>4</sub> (Methane). All of these gases occur naturally but human activity has greatly affected the extraction rate of these compounds. Since these gases stay in the atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years, they accumulate in the atmosphere and cause a myriad of negative effects for the environment and the ecosystems that it's composed of.

			The negative effects of climate change have been well documented over the years and we are reaching a point of no return in terms of preserving the environment in its entirety. This data seeks to inform about the dangers and abundance of greenhouse gases that are present around the world.

			The Data
		</h1>
		<p class="text">
			The data presented includes emission totals of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub>. All of which are represented as equivalent kilotons of CO<sub>2</sub> for continuity and easier understanding. Additionally, the distribution of emissions throughout five sectors: industry, buildings, transport, other industry, other sectors (all of which are measured in kilotons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions). Finally, the ratios per GPD and per capita are represented as equivalent amounts in kilotons of CO<sub>2</sub>. The ratio of emissions per GPD is the total emissions generated from $1,000 worth of product in the target country's economy. (<i><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Beginners:GDP_-_What_is_gross_domestic_product_(GDP)?" target="blank">Source</a></i>) The ratio per capita is the total emissions generated from each person.

			The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) has collected data estimates on emissions in over 220 countries since 1970, the project is officially endorsed by the European Union and is the basis for this web site's data. "EDGAR provides independent emission estimates compared to what reported by European Member States or by Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), using international statistics and a consistent IPCC methodology."
